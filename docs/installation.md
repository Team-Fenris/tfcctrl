# Installation manual

## Prerequisits
* Windows 10
* Python3 installed (PATH environment variables should be checked during install, to make sure that everything works properly)
* Python3 modules installed (see details below)
* Git (nice to have to pull latest code)

## Install Python modules
### Windows
Open Command Prompt with Administrator privileges.
Navigate to the directory where the repository are located.
When in the main directory, type `pip3.exe install -r requirements.txt` into the Command Prompt.
If you have configured Python3 correctly during installation, the command should work in the Command Prompt.

### Linux
This repository are mainly planned used in Windows.
Therefore Linux is not needed, except in cases where you develop in Linux and modules needs to be installed to efficiently develop code.
If you decide to use Linux with that reason (or some else reason), type `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` into the Linux terminal to install the required modules.
